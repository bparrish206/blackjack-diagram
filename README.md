The link above illustrates the problem domain for my earlier blackjack game.

The game has a class of cards, a deck and the blackjack game.  The deck is made up of cards, the game will deal two cards to the user and the dealer.  Then it will ask the user if they want to "hit" or another card.  Between the dealer and player whoever gets closer to 21 without going over wins the game.
